These files include the "tamagotchi" style game.

At the top you can enter a value in the input box to name your pet.

Below in the center are the levels of:
    1. Pet Age
    2. Hunger
    3. Sleepiness
    4. Boredom

These values are set at different intervals and when items 2-3 reach a value of 10 your pet dies.

Each item has a button which you can click on to feed your pet, wake your pet up and play with your pet to decrease its values below 10.

If your pet dies the page goes dark and you have the option to try again.

At the top right it shows who's turn it is either X or O.

To begin, click on a box that is empty.  If you click on a box that is taken you will see an error.

Take turns until the board is full.  If at anytime X or O wins the game board will disappear and display the winner.

If at anytime there is a draw the board will disappear and display the tie.

Score is kept by each player at the bottom.
